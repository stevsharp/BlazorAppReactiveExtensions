BlazorAppReactiveExtensions is a sample project that demonstrates the integration of Reactive Extensions (Rx) with Blazor, showcasing the benefits of using reactive programming paradigms in web development.

Introduction
This repository serves as a demonstration of combining Blazor, a framework for building interactive web UIs with .NET, and Reactive Extensions (Rx), a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences. By leveraging Rx in a Blazor application, developers can create highly responsive, real-time user interfaces with simplified state management and streamlined event handling.

Features
Reactive Event Handling: Utilize observables to handle events and manage asynchronous data streams efficiently.
State Management: Implement reactive state management to propagate changes across components seamlessly.
Real-time Updates: Enable real-time data updates and UI synchronization with minimal code complexity.
Functional Programming: Embrace functional programming principles for cleaner, more declarative code.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Build applications that run on both client and server, leveraging the power of .NET and WebAssembly.
